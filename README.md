> Pace calculator and charts

This is a quick-and-dirty Vue/Nuxt project designed to visualize the
interplay of running pace, speed, and distance. There are plenty of these
types of projects online, but I wanted an excuse to learn Nuxt.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ yarn install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
